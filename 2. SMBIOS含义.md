## SMBIOS

System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) is a standard developed by DMTF. The purpose of this standard is to allow the operating system to retrieve information about the PC.

On booting the SMBIOS will put a table somewhere in memory. By parsing this table it is possible to access information about the computer and its capabilities.
